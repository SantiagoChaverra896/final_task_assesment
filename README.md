## Task
Two-dimensional array consists of integer elements. Create new one dimensional array from it. Each new array element at index j is the sum of all elements in column j of the original array.  
```
Example 
        array: { { -12, 3, 5 },
                 { 6, -22, 3 },
                 { -30, -5, 13 } };
